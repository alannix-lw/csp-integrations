# Azure Compliance Integration CLI
 In order create an integration with azure for compliance, there needs to be an App with permissions to
all the subscriptions in the tenant that is to be monitored.
### Permission Requirements for the user running the Script
- User should have non interactive login enabled.
- The user needs to have Global Administrator role in the tenantâ€™s directory
- Additionally, the user needs to have Owner role in all the subscriptions that he wants to monitor.
### Permission Requirements for the Integration
- Access to the graph API, KeyVault API and the Storage API.
- Restricted access to the Windows Active Directory API.(Read Directory Data access)
- Reader role for all subscriptions that the user wants to monitor
- List keys and list secrets for all the Keys and secrets in all KeyVaults
### Script Requirements
- Requirements specified in the requirements.txt
- Python 2.7.10
- Linux or any Unix based OS
### Required Params
- credentials.type: The type of authentication to be used
    - USER_PASS: (Default). Authenticate via username and password
    - CLI: Authenticate via Azure CLI. You need to perform ```az login``` before running the script ensuring the azure cli has a valid active session. 
    - PORTAL: Authentication when running in the Portal's bash cloud shell. While running in this mode the script will not be able to grant permissions to the App
    on your behalf. You will need to do this manually before integrating the credentials. The script is restricted to the tenant 
    that you have currently selected in the UI. 
- credentials.userName: The email of the user
- credentials.Password: The password of the user (If authType is set to USER_PASS)
- tenantId: The tenant Id of the Ad in which the App is to be created.
- updatePermissionsForExistingApp:  true or false. If there already an app created, the user set it to true in if he has any existing subscriptions that he needs to monitor. Does not create new credentials if there is an existing App.
- tenantId: The tenant Id of the AD.
- subscriptionList: The user can provide a subset of subscriptions ids or names
- allSubscriptions: true or false. If set to true all subscriptions will be considered and the subscriptionList will be ignored
- registerProviders: true or false. The App requires access to the following providers:
    - Microsoft.KeyVault
    - Microsoft.Storage

    These are not registered by default. In order for the to access information related to these providers, the app needs to have access to their APIs. The app cannot be granted permission to access these APIs unless the providers are registered.  If the user chooses not to register them at that moment, he will have to give consent to the App later when he does register them.

### AppModes
#### Interactive
##### Command:
```./run.sh --mode INTERACTIVE --authType USER_PASS|CLI|PORTAL```
- In the interactive Mode the Cli will prompt the user to enter the necessary details.
- It will also ask the user to review entered details before beginning to execute the App Creation.
- Enter exit if you need to abort on any input prompt.
- The password input will be masked. There will be a warning displayed by the cli if the script is unable to mask the password input.
- It will detect if an app already exists and prompt you if you need to update the App.

#### Config File
##### Command:
```./run.sh --mode CONFIG_FILE```
In this mode the user place the config file in location ```client/config.json```
```
    {
     "credentials": {
       "type": "",   -- CLI, USER_PASS or PORTAL
       "userName": "",

     },
